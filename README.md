##Project Euler exercises##

These are my exercises at [**Project Euler**](http://projecteuler.net).

From logical and algorithmic point of view, I am primarily coding them in C++ (gcc 4.3). 

If you are a random traveler, who landed here during hunt for some solution - **I urge you to do exercises on your own.**. If you are really stuck, forums maybe able to help you out better. :)
